<p>This is the current SNU server. I am not using it for SNU yet. It will not be the upload server. It is very small compared to what I need, 9 terabytes are working, 8 terabytes are out (the big black box on the left is a broken seagate hard drive)</p>
<p>I really like Western Digital and SanDisk for things like external hard drives (WD) and SD cards (SanDisk)</p>
<p>However, SNU is developed only on a laptop at the moment using Mozilla Firefox 63.0-68.0.1, notepad++ 7.5.9, on Windows 10 (unfortunately, I will soon move to Linux on my next laptop, as I can't rewrite the laptop yet)</p>
<p>The server is offline right now. The laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15 3000, with 8 Gigabytes of RAM, 1000 Gigabytes of memory, 730p60 display, with over 100 Gigabytes dedicated to SNU development. It is just a start.</p>
<p>The original laptop I used for the beginning of SNU development was a Dell ######### with 4 Gigabytes of RAM, 500 Gigabytes of memory, 730p30 display, with about 20 Gigabytes dedicated to SNU development.</p>
<p>I am really wanting to upgrade my server, but server upgrades are expensive. To not repeat the incidents of the Seagate drive, I have to be very careful when getting new hard drives. I have to make sure it has good reviews, by at least 1000 people, and has good specs.</p>
<p>Don't worry, nothing was lost on the Seagate drive, it was just downloads, which I have soon gotten back.</p>
<p>The New Super Mario Bros DS is in the background since it was the only good display place. It is not related to the server setup in any way.</p>
